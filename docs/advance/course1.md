<br>
Fi Balaat Hiraql by Dr Abdur Raheem is the annotated text of the dialogue that took place in Shaam between Abu Sufyaan radiyAllaahuanhu  and Heraclius, king of Byzantine. The Sahabi was summoned and questioned by Heraclius to ascertain the Prophethood of Allah’s Messenger sallAllaahualayhi wasallam.

Points of benefit and moral lessons learnt, are quoted from the great works of Imaam an-Nawawiyy rahimahullaahu. Like all other books by Dr. Abdur Raheem, this book has extensive exercises to test grammar, comprehension and language skills.
