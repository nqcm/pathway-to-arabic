## Background

There are many people out there who want to learn Arabic but cannot do so because they do not have the time to enroll in full time study or they do not have access to a teacher or institute. I was one of them.

As a homeschooling mother my time was really limited so I could not enroll in an institute. I tried looking for private Arabic tutors but again that option didn’t work out. I bought lots of books and tried learning on my own but I would hit an obstacle, feel hopeless and give up learning.

Then I stumbled upon Madinah Arabic books and for the first time I felt that I can learn Arabic on my own. Fast forward 4 years and I am learning advance Arabic grammar and teaching beginner level Arabic grammar to ladies in my locality. Alhamdulillah.

There are lots of programs, curricula and books available to learn Arabic however I found that sticking to one program which builds upon your understanding is better than learning through lots of different curricula. Once you reach a certain level of comfort, you can supplement your studies with other books but when starting out I would recommend sticking to a single program or curriculum.

I myself followed the [mastering Arabic program for non-natives](http://drvaniya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Mastering-Arabic-Program-for-Non-Natives.pdf){target=\_blank} designed by [Dr. Abdur Raheem](http://drvaniya.com/?page_id=2){target=\_blank}, the author of world famous Madina Arabic books. I did use some supplemental resources here and there but otherwise I studied one book after the other in the exact order advised by the Sheikh himself.

There are many reasons I prefer this program over others but the biggest reason is that these books are syuitable for self-study since there is a wealth of resources available to help you study the books on your own. There is also a very active community of learners of these books which helps in staying motivated and asking for help. Many books from this program are available for free on the web, a kind courtesy of the author, Dr. Abdur Raheem, who has kept them royalty free. May Allah preserve him and accept his long services to His language. Ameen.

## About this site

!!! alert ""
This is a work in progress and I will keep adding new resources as I come across them so please check back often.

I have created this website as a place where I have organized all the resources I have personally used and/or found, while learning Arabic, for the benefit of others who want to learn Arabic on their own. This pathway is an expanded form of [the pathway designed by Dr. Abdur Raheem.](http://drvaniya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Mastering-Arabic-Program-for-Non-Natives.pdf){target=\_blank}. I have not only added resources to aid in learning Dr Abdur Raheem's pathway, but I have also added a few more resources which I personally found beneficial. At the end of the courses I have also added sections for guided reading and independent reading. [Happy learning!](/getting-started/){target=\_blank}
