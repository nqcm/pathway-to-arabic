## Introduction to Madinah Arabic Books

![Madinah Arabic books](/img/madinah-bk-1.jpg)

Madinah Arabic books is the world renowned program of study to learn Arabic language, used in Madinah Islamic University. These books are written by [Dr Abdur Raheem](http://drvaniya.com/?page_id=2) who very kindly has kept them royalty free. Which means you can download these books free from the web without violating any copyrights. By the end of these books, you will know and understand around 80% of the grammar of Quran, Insha Allah.

## A note about the volume numbers

Originally Dr Abdur Raheem has written 3 volumes of Madinah Arabic books, or to give them their proper name دروسُ اللغةِ العربيةِ لـغير الناطقين بـها (Durûs al-Lughah al-‘Arabiyyah li-Ghair al-Nâtiqîna Bihâ). Now these books are popularly known throughout the world as Madinah books. When Goodwords books and other publishers published these books by the name of Madinah Arabic Readers, they divided these three volumes into further volumes so there are altogether 8 volumes. Since these books are being used as text books in many schools, making smaller volumes means that kids in the school can study one book per year and finish the whole program in eight years.

!!! summary "To summarize"

    * Original Volume 1 = Madinah Arabic Reader volume 1 and 2
    * Original volume 2 = Madinah Arabic Reader volume 3, 4 and 5
    * Original volume 3 = Madinah Arabic Reader volume 6, 7 and 8

This gives rise to lots of confusion. So to clarify, when I refer to any volume of Madinah Arabic, I am referring to the original volume.

## Prerequisite for this section
