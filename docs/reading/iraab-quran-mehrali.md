# Videos of Grammatical Analysis of the Quran by Brother Asif Mehrali

Anyone who has learnt Arabic through Madinah Arabic books by watching LQ Toronto videos is indebted to brother Asif Mehrali. He is a great teacher. In these videos he is doing a guided reading of the book إعراب القرآن الكريم by Dr Mahmood Suleman Yaqoot.

!!! tip "This is a work in progress and I will keep adding new books/resources as they are released so please check back often."

**Prerequisite for this section**

You can start reading these books alongside other courses. But ideally you should first complete the three Madinah Books before you will be able to understand these books.
