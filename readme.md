## Background

I have created this website as a place where I have organized all the resources I have personally used and/or found, while learning Arabic, for the benefit of others who want to learn Arabic on their own. This pathway is an expanded form of [the pathway designed by Dr. Abdur Raheem.](http://drvaniya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Complete-Mastering-Arabic-Program-for-Non-Natives.pdf). I have not only added resources to aid in learning Dr Abdur Raheem's pathway, but I have also added a few more resources which I personally found beneficial. At the end of the courses I have also added sections for guided reading and independent reading.

Happy learning!  👌
